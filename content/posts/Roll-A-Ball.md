In this project we learned the basics of using Unity. We followed the tutorial which showed us the structure of VR projects along with how to insert objects into the world. 

**1 SETTING UP THE GAME**

The most difficult part was to download the right version that was compatible with the files provided. 
We got to work on Unity without too much trouble, adding the very firsts object was pretty easy.

**2 MOVING THE PLAYER**
=
In this part, we added a Rigidbody to the Player sphere, using physics engine, we wrote our first script in C# to make the sphere roll using the keyboard.
